                            <p className="sm:text-sm font-mono">From my background UI & UX designers & digital artists are all considered as graphic designers, and the society at large doesnâ€™t know about every design layer that is archivable<br /> <br />From the moment I stumbled upon the captivating world of UI designs, I found out that its not just about crafting visually appealing interfaces; it was about making technology seamlessly integrate into people's lives. What hooked me was the power to solve problems, and create experiences that leave an indelible mark.<br /><br />Each project becomes a new canvas, and every interaction is an opportunity to connect with users on a profound level. The incessant pursuit of perfection, the thrill of bringing concepts to life, and the ever-evolving landscape of design are the driving forces that fuel my passion.<br /><br />UI design isn't just a profession; it's a journey of discovery, innovation, and the joy of turning imagination into reality.

                            <p className="sm:text-sm">For me, is not just a game. Thanks to my father who was a seasoned rugby player, I was naturally drawn to the sport that shaped my early memories, growing up to the deafening sound of cleats on the field. I was inspired by watching one world cup season when i was still a kid.<br /><br /> What keeps me interested is the relationship among teammates, the symphony of training, and the strategic plays between opponents. The rugby field is my proving ground, where i go out and relieve myself from my daily activities. Career-wise, the sport isn't merely a pursuit; it's a dedication to surpass limits, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. In every scrum and sprint, I find a testament to an enduring legacy in my lifetime.</p>
